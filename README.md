## Introduction

The industrial production index is a valuable measure of the output and activity within the industry sector. This guide focuses on using MATLAB to perform basic statistical calculations, visualize data, and implement sampling and cleaning methods on this dataset.

## Basic Statistics

### 2.1 Mean Calculation

The **mean** represents the average value of the dataset and is a simple measure of central tendency. Calculating the mean of the industrial production index helps identify the general level of production over a specified period.

Example code for calculating the mean:
```matlab
% Example: Calculating the mean production index for a specified entity
entity = 'Germany';
time_range = [datetime(2023, 1, 1), datetime(2023, 12, 31)];

% Filter data for the selected entity and time range
filtered_data = data(strcmp(data.GeopoliticalEntity, entity) & ...
                    data.Time >= time_range(1) & data.Time <= time_range(2), :);
production_index = filtered_data.ProductionVolume;

% Calculate mean production index
mean_value = mean(production_index);
disp(['Mean Production Index for ', entity, ': ', num2str(mean_value)]);
```

### 2.2 Median Calculation

The median is the middle value when the data is ordered from smallest to largest. Unlike the mean, the median is less affected by extreme values and can provide a better measure of central tendency for skewed data.

Example code for calculating the median:

```matlab
% Calculate median production index
median_value = median(production_index);
disp(['Median Production Index for ', entity, ': ', num2str(median_value)]);
```
### 2.3 Mode Calculation

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. It is useful for identifying the most common production index values during the selected period.

Example code for calculating the mode:
```matlab
% Calculate mode production index
mode_value = mode(production_index);
disp(['Mode Production Index for ', entity, ': ', num2str(mode_value)]);
```
